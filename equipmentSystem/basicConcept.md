# p1. attach weapon
when a customized event is triggered, we attach specific items to the specific socket on the character.

The question is, which item(given on name or mesh) is on which socket?

Others are just ignorable details like Simulate the Physical blahblhablah

# p2. match the animations
as the title said, we attached items, then we want them all functional or, at least seem to be functional.

Implement it with different animations, such as stance or attack animations. 

I mean, we could blend Animations, like walking&operating some handy stuff
